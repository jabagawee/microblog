microblog
=========

A decently featured microblogging web application written in Python and Flask that I'm developing in my Flask Mega-Tutorial series that begins [here](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Basically, I just forked it, went from the initial commit, and I'll be
learning how to do things from this project. Some additions I might make
are... some other SQL server? Heroku deployment? Who knows.
